## Installation

### Raspbian
Raspbian is the Foundationâ€™s official supported operating system and the best bet if you want the best hardware support.
To install Raspbian download the current image from the download page:
https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/

**Note**: We are recommend to use the Full Desktop image

After you downloaded the Raspbian image to through the installation guide for you specific plattform:
* **Linux**: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/linux.md
* **Mac**: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/mac.md
* **Windows**: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/windows.md

Before you eject the SD Card just add the following line to the ```/config.txt```
```
dtoverlay=pi3-miniuart-bt
```
This command will enable the login via the ```UART-Interface``` with a console/TTL cable

## Configuration

sudo ./install.sh
```

### Testing I2C Ports
To check everything is working just run the ```sudo i2cdetect -y 1``` command in the terminal.
If there are some error's just google or check out the [Adafruit Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-4-gpio-setup/configuring-i2c) to enable the i2c ports on the Raspberry PI.
