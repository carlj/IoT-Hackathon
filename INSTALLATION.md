# IoT Raspberry PI Documentation

## Installation

### Raspbian
Raspbian is the Foundationâ€™s official supported operating system and the best bet if you want the best hardware support.
To install Raspbian download the current image from the download page:
https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/

**Note**: We are recommend to use the Full Desktop image

After you downloaded the Raspbian image to through the installation guide for you specific plattform:
* **Linux**: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/linux.md
* **Mac**: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/mac.md
* **Windows**: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/windows.md

Before you eject the SD Card just add the following line to the ```/config.txt```
```
dtoverlay=pi3-miniuart-bt
```
This command will enable the login via the ```UART-Interface``` with a console/TTL cable

## Configuration

### Basic Settings
To enabled the basic settings just type in:
```
sudo raspi-config
```

For a basic configuration you need to set the following options:
* [1] Expand Filesystem: Yes
* [6] Enable Camera: Enable
* [9] Advanced Options -> [A2] Hostname: ```raspberrypiXX``` (e.g.) ```raspberrypi09```
* [9] Advanced Options -> [A6] I2C: Enable the ```ARM I2C Interface``` and the ```I2C Kernel Modul```
* [9] Advanced Options -> [AA] 1-Wire: Enable

After the configuration the is a reboot needed: ```sudo shutdown -r now```.

### Install all of the needed sources
To install all of the needed sources, libraries and package just execute the ```install.sh``` script in the root directory of the git repo.
```
sudo ./install.sh
```

### Testing I2C Ports
To check everything is working just run the ```sudo i2cdetect -y 1``` command in the terminal.
If there are some error's just google or check out the [Adafruit Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-4-gpio-setup/configuring-i2c) to enable the i2c ports on the Raspberry PI.


### Desktop
By default the Desktop is enable, to boot without the desktop just run the following in the terminal:
```
sudo raspi-config
```
Go to boot options and change to the needed option and reboot.

## Camera

There are few steps needed to use the Raspberry Pi Camera

### Installation

Open the Raspberry Pi configuration with ```sudo raspi-config``` and enable the camera. If you have the v1 version of the camera you are good to go and can skip to the next point. For the [v2](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/new-8-megapixel-camera-board-sale-25/) version please continue with the following steps:

### Using the camera

There are detailed information about the camera usage with [python](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/camera/python/README.md) and [bash](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/camera/raspicam/README.md) on the official raspberry pi website: https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/camera-module-setup/
